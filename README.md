 - üìê Supports 1x1 textures and 1x2 textures
 - üé® DXT-1 and DXT-5 support
 - üöÄ Multithreaded! Will work on 4 textures at the same time speeding up conversions!

## Usage

This list will go through the steps, and down the list of things on the screen.

1. Open the application
2. Click SELECT FILES. Select the files you want to convert.
   - You MUST only select textures that have the same UV-mapping at a time.
   - Example: only textures for `jbib_023.ydd`
3. Decide if you want a background color. It is gray. `#1F2020`.
4. Decide if you want a border around your texture. Select one from the dropdown.
5. (EXPERIMENTAL) You can have the program attempt to rearrange your texture in a more optimized arrangement. This probably won't work but it might?
6. Decide if the texture is square. Some textures (shoes) won't be.
7. Set the width you want.
8. If not square, set the height here.
9. IMPORTANT: select DXT-1 for textures without transparency. Select DXT-5 for textures with transparency.
10. Click start!
